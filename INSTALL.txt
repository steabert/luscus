   LUSCUS installation guide. 26/01 2018. 


LUSCUS as Graphical User Interface depends on many graphical libraries,
which are different for different operating systems. 

Note, that these graphical libries might be installed at your computer 
only as run-time packages, instead of full installation, which includes
headers and libraries for development. 

I. Check and install graphical libraries (devel versions). 
----------------

The list of libraries:
gl
glu
gtk+-2.0 or gtk+-3.0
OpenGL
gtkglext

CMake installation should spot missing libraries, but it is
advisable to check these libraries before running cmake command. 

To check that you have installed these packages, use e.g. locate 
command, and search for headers .h and libraries with extension .a,
or .so.

Example: 
locate glu.h
locate libGLU

in many system installing gtkglext-dev (or gtkglext-devel) will
install via dependencies all needed packages. 

II. Important: LUSCUS package
----------------
 
Luscus package includes luscus executable, configuration files and plug-ins. 
    - Luscus executable should be located in somewhere in your PATH.
    - Configuration files can located at:
          - directory pointed by environment $LUSCUS_DIR
          - directory $HOME/.luscus
          - directory /etc/luscus/
          - directory of luscus executable
    - Plug-ins can be installed in any location, the direct path 
        to plug-ins is set in configurations files. 

Relocation of the parts of Luscus package will break the 
functionality of the code. 

--------------------

III. Compiling on Linux
---------------------

There are several options for compiling LUSCUS under linux, 
depending on the libraries installed on your computer. 
LUSCUS can be compiled against [gtk+-2.0] or [gtk+-3.0] graphical libraries. 
Also, LUSCUS can be also compiled with or without [gtkglext] library. 

Please note that some functionality of LUSCUS, e.g. screenshots with 
large resolution are enabled only for binaries that are compiled 
with gtkglext library. Three combinations of libraries are tested:

* gtk+-2.0 with gtkglext
* gtk+-2.0 without gtkglext
* gtk+-3.0 without gtkglext

steps for compiling luscus:

1. Install required graphical libraries
   Use program package tools (like apt or rpm) from linux distribution (advised), 
   or download source code of these packages and compile them. Make sure to 
   install package with development files. In Debian or Ubuntu linux distributions 
   the best option is to install  libgtkglext1-dev package, since all other 
   required libraries are dependent on it and will be installed automatically.

2. Download luscus source from this 
   [link](https://sourceforge.net/projects/luscus/?source=directory).

3. uncompress and untar the source
   gunzip luscus_0.8.*.tar.gz
   tar -xvf luscus_0.8.*.tar

4. select build directory (cd build)

5. run cmake 
   Note, that by default LUSCUS will be installed globally 
   in case if you do not have root permissions use 
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$HOME
   If you are root, you can type
    cmake ..
   Fix all problems, detected by cmake

6. run make: make

7. install luscus: sudo make install
   Note that make install places all parts of Luscus package into
   proper locations. 

  If you install Luscus for several users, be sure that 
  all users have an access to plug-ins. The simplest way to 
  achieve it to use LUSCUS_DIR variable. 

IV. Compiling under Windows (experimental)
-----------------------

Gtk+ applications are compiled with [Mingw] environment. 
For instalation of Mingw and gtk+ under windows please refer 
to their webpages. Gtkglext must be installed also.

The installation is silmilar to Linux, but use 
 cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles" ..

Make sure that plugins and configurational files are installed in 
directory $LOCALAPPDATA/luscus. Alternatively, use environment 
variable LUSCUS_DIR

V. Compiling on Mac OS
----------------------

Use port package manager and install gtkglext package

The rest is similar to Linux installation.
